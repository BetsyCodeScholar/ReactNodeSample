# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# React and Node.js Project

This project is a combination of a React frontend and a Node.js backend.

# Overview

This project serves as a starting point for building a full-stack web application using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. It includes a basic directory structure and setup to help you get started quickly.

# Features

React Frontend: Includes a simple React application scaffolded with Create React App.
Node.js Backend: Provides a basic Node.js server to handle API requests and serve static files.
Routing: Routing setup using React Router on the frontend and Express.js on the backend.
Example API: Includes an example API endpoint to demonstrate communication between the frontend and backend.

# Getting Started

# Prerequisites
Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

# Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    git clone <repository_url>

2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    cd react-nodejs-project

3.  Install dependencies for both the frontend and backend:
    1.  cd dummy-backend
    2.  npm install

    1. cd react-crash-course
    2. npm install

# Usage

1.  Start the Node.js server:
    1. cd dummy-backend
    2. npm start
    
2.  Start the React development server:
    1. cd react-crash-course
